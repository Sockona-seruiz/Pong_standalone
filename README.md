# Pong_standalone

A standalone version of my 3D online pvp Pong.

It includes online pvp with matchmaking and 2 game modes.
Also lets you spectate other players.

Build with ```docker-compose up --build```

Then go to ```http://localhost:8080/``` and choose your nickname.

Use 'W' and 'S' to play !
